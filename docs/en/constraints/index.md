# ðŸ”’ Introduction to Constraints in MacroDroid

**Constraints** in MacroDroid are conditions that control whether a macro or specific actions within it will execute after a trigger is activated. They act as filters, ensuring your automations only run when specific conditions are met, making them precise and context-aware. MacroDroid supports two types of constraints: **General Constraints** and **Individual Constraints**, both of which can use logical operators (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) for flexible customization.

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Constraints

### 1. General Constraints
- **Location**: Found at the bottom of the macro editing screen in the **Constraints** section.
- **Behavior**: These constraints affect the **entire macro**. If any general constraint evaluates to false, the macro will not execute at all, regardless of the trigger.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for setting broad conditions that determine whether the macro should run.

#### Example:
A macro that turns on Wi-Fi when you connect your charger (trigger: "Charger Connected") might have a general constraint like "Time of Day: 8:00 AM - 10:00 PM" to ensure the entire macro only runs during the day.

### 2. Individual Constraints
- **Location**: Applied directly to a specific **trigger** or **action**. To add one, tap the action or trigger in the macro editing screen and select **Add Constraint**.
- **Behavior**: These constraints only affect the specific trigger or action theyâ€™re attached to. If the constraint fails, only that particular action or trigger is skipped, allowing other parts of the macro to proceed.
- **Use Case**: Perfect for fine-tuning individual actions or triggers within a macro.

#### Example:
In a macro with multiple actions, you could add an individual constraint to a "Send Notification" action, such as "Battery Level > 30%," so the notification only appears if the battery is above 30%, while other actions in the macro run regardless.

## ðŸ”¹ How Do Constraints Work?

1. **Evaluation**: Constraints are checked **after** the macroâ€™s trigger is activated.
2. **Condition**: For a macro or action to proceed, all constraints (general or individual) must evaluate to true. If any constraint is false, the affected macro or action stops.
3. **Logical Operators**: Both general and individual constraints support **AND**, **OR**, **XOR**, and **NOT** operators, allowing you to create complex conditions.
   - **AND**: All conditions must be true.
   - **OR**: At least one condition must be true.
   - **XOR**: Exactly one condition must be true.
   - **NOT**: Inverts the conditionâ€™s result.

### Example with Logical Operators:
A general constraint might combine "Wi-Fi Connected" **AND** "Day of the Week: Weekdays" to ensure a macro only runs when connected to Wi-Fi on a weekday.

## ðŸ”¹ Common Constraint Examples

MacroDroid offers a wide range of constraints to customize your macros. Some popular options include:
- **Time-Based**: "Day of the Week" (e.g., only Monday to Friday) or "Time of Day."
- **Device State**: "Battery Level" (e.g., above 30%) or "Silent Mode."
- **Connectivity**: "Wi-Fi Connection" (e.g., only at home) or "Bluetooth Enabled."
- **Apps**: "Foreground App" (e.g., only if WhatsApp is open).

## ðŸ”¹ Why Use Constraints?

- **Precision**: Ensure macros or specific actions only run under the exact conditions you define.
- **Efficiency**: Prevent unnecessary resource usage, like battery or data.
- **Customization**: Use general constraints for macro-wide control or individual constraints for granular control over specific actions or triggers.

### Practical Example:
A macro that silences your phone when you arrive at work (trigger: "Location") could include:
- A **general constraint** like "Time of Day: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM" to ensure the macro only runs during work hours.
- An **individual constraint** on a "Send Notification" action, like "Battery Level > 20%," to only send the notification if the battery is sufficiently charged.

Constraints, with their support for general and individual applications and logical operators, are a cornerstone of MacroDroidâ€™s flexibility. Experiment with them to create smarter, more efficient automations, whether youâ€™re a beginner or an advanced user!
