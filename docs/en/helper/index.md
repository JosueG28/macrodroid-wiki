# Understanding MacroDroid Helper Apps for Android Automation

## Why Helper Apps Are Necessary üîß

Android has progressively restricted apps from controlling core system functions like WiFi/Bluetooth toggling. For MacroDroid to automate these features, it uses helper apps built with older Android tools that still have necessary permissions. Think of them as "specialized tools" that bypass Android's restrictions when MacroDroid needs to control system features.
