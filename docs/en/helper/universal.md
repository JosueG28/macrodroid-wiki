# üõ†Ô∏è Universal Helper Installation Guide (Android 14+)

This guide provides a beginner-friendly step-by-step explanation on how to install the **MacroDroid Universal Helper APK** on devices running Android 14 or higher using **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**. Since Android 14 blocks direct installation of older APKs via standard methods, ADB is required. This tutorial assumes **zero command-line experience**, and explains how to set the `platform-tools` path, where to place the APK, and how to avoid common pitfalls.

  - Use copy-paste for commands to avoid typos.
  - Always run commands inside the `platform-tools` folder unless you‚Äôve added it to your system‚Äôs PATH.

- **Advanced ADB Use**:
  - To use `adb` from anywhere, you can add `platform-tools` to your system‚Äôs environment PATH.
