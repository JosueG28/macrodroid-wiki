# âš¡ Introduction to Actions in MacroDroid

**Actions** in MacroDroid are the tasks your device performs when a macro runs. They are the core of any automation, defining what the macro does once its trigger is activated and constraints are met. From sending notifications to controlling device hardware, actions allow you to customize your deviceâ€™s behavior in powerful and flexible ways.

## ðŸ”¹ What Are Actions?

An **action** is any task your device can execute as part of a macro. For a macro to be valid, it must include **at least one action**. MacroDroid offers a wide variety of actions, ranging from simple tasks like adjusting screen brightness to complex ones like making HTTP requests or running scripts.

### Example:
A macro with the trigger "Charger Connected" might include an action like "Turn On Wi-Fi" to automatically connect your device to a network when plugged in.

## ðŸ”¹ Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Actions

### Synchronous Actions
Most MacroDroid actions execute quickly and sequentially, meaning each action waits for the previous one to complete before starting.

### Asynchronous Actions
Certain actions, such as **HTTP requests** or **shell scripts**, may take longer to complete. By default, these actions run **asynchronously**, meaning subsequent actions in the macro might start before the asynchronous action finishes.

#### Managing Asynchronous Actions
- **"Block Next Action Until Complete" Option**: Enable this in the actionâ€™s configuration interface to ensure subsequent actions wait for the asynchronous action to finish before proceeding.
- **Note**: Unlike traditional programming languages where you might use a callback function to handle data returned by an asynchronous action, MacroDroidâ€™s internal mechanics donâ€™t offer a systematic callback option. Instead, youâ€™ll need to use workarounds, such as storing results in variables or adding wait actions (e.g., "Wait X Seconds") to manage asynchronous flow.

### Example:
If you have an "HTTP Request" action that fetches data from an API, enable "Block Next Action Until Complete" to ensure a subsequent "Show Notification" action, displaying the retrieved data, doesnâ€™t run until the request is complete.

## ðŸ”¹ Common Action Examples

MacroDroid provides a broad range of actions to customize your automations. Some popular ones include:
- **Notifications**: Display a message on-screen or send a push notification.
- **Device Control**: Adjust volume, change brightness, or toggle Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or mobile data.
- **Apps**: Open an app, close an app, or simulate screen taps.
- **Connectivity**: Send emails, SMS messages, or make HTTP requests.
- **Advanced**: Run shell scripts, manipulate variables, or control hardware like the camera or flashlight.

## ðŸ”¹ Why Are Actions Important?

- **Functionality**: Actions are what make your macros "do something," turning ideas into practical automations.
- **Flexibility**: With hundreds of actions available, you can tailor macros to almost any task.
- **Control**: The ability to manage synchronous and asynchronous actions lets you create precise and efficient workflows.

### Practical Example:
A macro triggered when headphones are connected (trigger: "Headphones Connected") could include the following actions:
1. "Open Spotify" to launch your music app.
2. "Set Volume" to adjust the volume to 50%.
3. "Show Notification" with the text "Enjoy your music!".

## ðŸ”¹ Tips for New Users

- **Explore Actions**: Browse the action list in the macro editing screen to discover whatâ€™s possible.
- **Start Simple**: Try actions like "Show Notification" or "Turn On Wi-Fi" to understand how they work.
- **Test Always**: Run your macro after setting it up to ensure actions behave as expected.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tips for Advanced Users

- **Combine Actions**: Use multiple actions in a macro to create complex automations, like fetching data from an API and processing it with variables.
- **Handle Asynchrony**: Use the "Block Next Action" option or add wait actions to control the flow of macros with asynchronous actions.
- **Leverage Variables**: Store action results (e.g., HTTP request data) in variables for further manipulation in later steps.
