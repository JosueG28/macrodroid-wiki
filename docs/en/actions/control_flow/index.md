# üõ†Ô∏è Control Flow in MacroDroid

**Control Flow** actions let you direct how your MacroDroid macros run, creating smart, dynamic automations. Explore these tools to build precise workflows:

### [If clause](<if_clause.md>): Run actions based on specific conditions.  

### [If confirmed then](<if_clause.md>): Execute actions after user confirmation.  

### [Repeat actions](<if_clause.md>): Loop actions a fixed number of times, while a condition is true, once then repeat while a condition holds, or endlessly until a break.  
  
### [Iterate Dicionary/Array](<if_clause.md>): Process each item in a dictionary or array.  
  
### [Break from loop](<if_clause.md>): Exit a loop early when a condition is met.  

### [Continue loop](<if_clause.md>): Skip to the next loop iteration.
