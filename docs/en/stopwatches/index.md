# ⏱️ Stopwatches in MacroDroid

Stopwatches allow you to **measure elapsed time** inside your macros — perfect for tracking durations, delays, or custom time-based logic.

## 📍 Where to Find Stopwatches

You can access and manage stopwatches from the **Stopwatch tile** on the **main screen** of MacroDroid.  
From there, you can:

- ➕ **Create** new stopwatches  
- ✏️ **Rename** existing stopwatches  
- 🗑️ **Delete** stopwatches you no longer need  
- ▶️ **Start/Stop** any stopwatch manually

## 🧩 Using Stopwatches in Macros

Stopwatches can be integrated into different parts of your macros:

### 🔫 Trigger  
*Trigger a macro based on stopwatch conditions*  
👉 [Introduction to triggers](../triggers/index.md)  
👉 [Stopwatch trigger](../actions/stopwatch.md)

### 🎬 Action  
*Start, stop, reset, or get the current time from a stopwatch*  
👉 [Introduction to actions](../actions/index.md)  
👉 [Stopwatch action](../actions/stopwatch.md)

### 🚧 Constraint/Condition  
*Run actions only if a stopwatch has passed or not passed a set duration*  
👉 [Introduction to constraints](../constraints/index.md)  
👉 [Stopwatch constraint](../constraints/stopwatch.md)

### ✨ Magic Text  
*Use stopwatch values dynamically in text fields (e.g., notifications, logs)*  
👉 [Magic text introduction](../magic_text/index.md)  
👉 [Magic text stopwatch](../magic_text/no_trigger/magic_text_stopwatches.md)

## 🛠️ Common Use Cases

- Measure how long since an event happened  
- Delay actions until a stopwatch exceeds a time  
- Reset time after specific conditions  
- Log or display how much time passed between two points

> Think of stopwatches as **custom timers you control** — start them when something begins, stop them when it ends, and use that info to make smart decisions inside your macros.
