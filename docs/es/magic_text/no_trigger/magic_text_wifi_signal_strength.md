# ✨ Magic Text: `{wifi_strength}`

**Returns:**  
A number representing the Wi-Fi signal strength in decibels (dBm). The value is usually negative.

**Example:**  
`-60` → Stronger Wi-Fi signal  
`-70` → Weaker Wi-Fi signal

**Usage:**  
Can be used in any text field that supports Magic Text (e.g., notifications, text-to-speech, logs, etc.).

**Simple explanation:**  
This Magic Text tells you how strong your Wi-Fi connection is. The number is negative, but the closer it is to zero, the better the signal. So, `-60` is a stronger signal than `-70`.

> ℹ️ **Note:**  
A stronger signal means better connection quality and faster speeds.
