# ✨ Magic Text: `{week_of_year}`

**Returns:**  
The current week number of the year as a whole number. For example, January 3rd, 2025 (a Wednesday) falls in week `1`.

**Example:**  
`1` → First week of the year  
`15` → Fifteenth week of the year

**Usage:**  
Can be used in any text field that supports Magic Text (e.g., notifications, text-to-speech, logs, etc.).

**Simple explanation:**  
This Magic Text tells you which week of the year it currently is. The year is divided into weeks starting from the first week in January. It helps track time in weeks instead of days or months.

> ℹ️ **Note:**  
The exact week number can depend on local settings, but usually, the first week starts with January 1st.
